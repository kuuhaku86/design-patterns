# Design Patterns

Design Pattern Example in Various Language

## What is Design Pattern?

Design patterns represent the best practices used by experienced object-oriented software developers. Design patterns are solutions to general problems that software developers faced during software development. These solutions were obtained by trial and error by numerous software developers over quite a substantial period of time.

## Type of Design Pattern

We can group design pattern into three categories. 

### Creational Patterns

These design patterns provide a way to create objects while hiding the creation logic, rather than instantiating objects directly using new operator. This gives program more flexibility in deciding which objects need to be created for a given use case.

### Structural Patterns

These design patterns concern class and object composition. Concept of inheritance is used to compose interfaces and define ways to compose objects to obtain new functionalities.

### Behavioral Patterns

These design patterns are specifically concerned with communication between objects.

## Example of Design Pattern

There is example design pattern for every type.
